# To design TTS Fe metalloenzyme based on 1ukr bb.

The 1ukr is a good candidate considering the hole is hydrophilic.

Using the selfcenter with 2ndshell search '1ukr_39-68-116_D-H-H_a.pdb', it seems like 68-77-79_DHH is a good candidate condsidering 77H and 79H have good overlap score as well as good looking 2ndshell gvdm.
The AF2 result, however, mostly could not keep the 77H which bond with 68D instead.

Trying search new bb '1ukr_68-77-79_DHH.pdb', it seems like 68-77-79_HDH or 68-77-79_HHD is better considering 2ndshell gvdm, even the overlap number is low. 
The AF2 result, at least, could roughly keep the mvdm at the right position.

Overall, the four aa matters for mvdms on the bb are: 64E-79H, 129D-79H, 164H-68H, 127Q-77D, 70W-77H.

Plan to order two.
